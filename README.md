# Zsh Timecard

I've been attempting to keep track of my time spent on various projects, 
using a google spreadsheet. This is plenty efficient and easy for me to 
use, but I got curious: could I write a simple Zsh script to do this for 
me?

at its simplest, all i'd do is specify the project, and submit 'start' and 
'stop' as inputs. 'print' would  output a table of total time 
spent on each project.

i have limited experience writing Zsh script, and thought this might also 
be a good opportunity to test the ever-popular ChatGPT as a learning tool. 
i submitted my project parameters into chatGPT, and it gave me a raw 
script. It is not fucntional yet, but it provided me opportunity to ask 
questions about basic Bash syntax. I'll be continuing to improve this, 
relying partially on chat gpt.
